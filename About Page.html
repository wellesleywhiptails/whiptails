		<h2> About </h2>
			<p> The Ultimate Frisbee team at Wellesley, or the Whiptails, combines 
				a drive for strong athleticism and sportsmanship with a fun community of close 
				friends and teammates. If you're interested in joining, check out our site and 
				come by one of our open practices in the fall. We look forward to meeting you! </p>
		
			<p>	Besides playing intense women's Ultimate, Whiptails enjoy dance parties 
				(planned or impromptu), dressing in flair, pranking, singing/dancing to 
				Jason Derulo's "Talk Dirty to Me," taking over the campus center dining 
				hall, and being weird in public.</p>

				<h3> History </h3>
			
					<p>The Whiptails unofficially began in 1996 as a group of Wellesley students 
					interested in this whole "Frisbee" thing. Not much is known about the early 
					days of the Whiptails, besides that Ultimate kept a strong enough following at
					Wellesley for our team to finally be constitutionalized as a club sport in 2003.</p>
			 
					<p>Since then our program has continued to grow. By 2006 we were a large enough
					 group to split into an A-team (the Whips) and a B-team (the Tails) for the 
					 competitive spring season. In 2010 and 2011 the Whips went to Division III 
					 Nationals, finishing 9th in the country in 2011. In 2012 we came in fourth at
			 		 New England Regionals, missing the chance to go to Nationals by one spot. 
			 		 We hope to bring in a strong crop of new players this Fall and send the Whips
			  		 to Nationals again next Spring Season!</p>
